## First Post

As React applications grow, managing state across multiple components can become complex and difficult to maintain. This is where Redux comes in, providing a predictable state management solution that helps developers maintain consistency across their applications. In this post, weâ€™ll explore Redux, specifically using Redux Toolkit, to make our state management simpler and more efficient.

```js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```
